<h2>About URLGent</h2>

<p>A small utility to extract data from various resources on the Internet.</p>

<h3>Privacy</h3>

<p><strong>How much is captured?</strong></p>
<p>Not much really. URLGent doesn't set a cookie
  in your browser or track you in any other way. Your personally identifiable information
  (including IP, location, browser, etc) is not captured at any point.</p>

<p><strong>What is stored?</strong></p>
<ul>
  <li>a generalised event log (accessible on <a href="/stats">Stats</a> page)</li>
  <li>60 minute history of all lookups made and their results (but not who made those requests) *
    <br />
    [* In the alpha development stage the cleanup will only happen manually so
    the history may remain for longer period of time. The 60 minute timeout target may change in the future.]
  </li>
</ul>
<p>That's it. I just need to have a general idea about usage level.<p>
